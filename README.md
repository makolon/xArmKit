## TODO

- [ ] **Run pi0 with collected data using openpi and evaluate**
  - Use the `openpi` framework to run pi0 model with the collected dataset.
  - Perform evaluation and analyze the results.

- [ ] **Create dataset with recorded scene graphs**
  - Build a dataset that includes scene graph recordings.

- [ ] **Verify PDDLStream using ViLaIn**
  - Integrate `ViLaIn` approach to validate and verify the `PDDLStream` task and motion planning pipeline.

- [ ] **Create Digital Twin with real2sim-eval and evaluate VLA**
  - Use the `real2sim-eval` to construct a digital twin environment.
  - Evaluate VLA model performance in this simulated twin environment.

- [ ] **UMI-based Data Collection & Policy Training**
  - Implement UMI-based data collection system similar to [touch_in_the_wild](https://github.com/YolandaXinyueZhu/touch_in_the_wild)
  - Train policy models (e.g., RDT2, ACT, Diffusion Policy) using collected UMI datasets
